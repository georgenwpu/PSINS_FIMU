//! Specialization of a CChartCursor class for a dragline cursor.
/**
	A dragline cursor is a simple vertical or horizontal line associated
	with a specific axis. The line can be moved if the user clicks on the
	line (and keeps the button pressed) and moves the mouse. Once the mouse
	button is released, the line doesn't move anymore.<br>
	To create a dragline cursor, call the CreateDragLineCursor from the
	CChartCtrl class.
