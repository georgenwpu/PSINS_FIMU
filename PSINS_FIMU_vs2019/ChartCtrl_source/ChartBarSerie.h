//! Specialization of a CChartSerie to display a bars series.
/**
	This class is a specialized series class used to display vertical (default) 
	or horizontal bars. Each bar in the series is centered around its X value 
	(for vertical bars) or Y value (for horizontal bars). Bars can be grouped 
	together, so that they do not overlap but are stacked next to each other 
	(or on top of each other). This is done by specifying a group Id: bar series 
	with the same group Id will be grouped together (stacked). Series with different 
	group Id will be independant (they will be drawn as if they were the only one, 
	meaning that the different series will probably overlap).
