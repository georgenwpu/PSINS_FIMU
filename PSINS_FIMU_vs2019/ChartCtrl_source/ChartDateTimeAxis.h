		The tick increment is the value between two adjacents
		ticks on the axis. In case of a date time axis, the interval
		is specified by a time period because this interval might not
		be constant (for instance, if a tick interval of one month is 
		specified, the distance between two adjacents ticks is not 
		constant: it depends on the number of days in the month).
		The full tick interval is made of a base interval (day, month,
		hour, ...) and a multiplier, that is applied to this base interval.
		So, for an interval of three months between two ticks, you have to
		specify tiMonth for the interval and 3 for the multiplier.

	/**
		The reference tick is a date/time which specifies a tick which should
		always be displayed on the axis. This is needed when the tick
		interval multiplier is not 1 (e.g. the interval between two ticks is 3 
		months). In that specific case, there is no way for the control to know 
		which ticks should be displayed (in our example, the chart doesn't know 
		if the first tick will be january, february or march). This is particularly
		annoying when the axis is panned (in that case, if we always take the first
		month on the axis as first tick, the ticks will always switch from one month
		to another). By having a refence tick, this forces the control to calculate
		all tick intervals based on this reference. It is set to January 1st 2000 by
		default.
